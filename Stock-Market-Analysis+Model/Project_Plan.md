- **Deliverables**:
  - Preprocessed dataset with engineered features.
  - Explanation of each feature and its relevance.

#### **Step 4: Model Development**
- **Tasks**:
  1. **Baseline Models**:
     - Implement simple models like ARIMA and Linear Regression to establish a performance baseline.

     - Implement models using libraries like `keras`, `tensorflow`, or `pytorch`.
  3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
     - Use GridSearchCV or Random Search to tune hyperparameters.
  4. **Cross-Validation**:
     - Apply time series cross-validation methods to evaluate models (e.g., walk-forward validation).
  5. **Ensemble Methods**:
     - Optionally, create ensemble models by combining predictions from multiple models.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Trained models with evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
  - Model comparison report identifying the best model(s).

#### **Step 5: Model Evaluation and Interpretation**
- **Tasks**:
  1. **Evaluation**:
     - Evaluate the final model on the test set using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
     - Plot the predicted vs. actual stock prices to visualize model performance.
  2. **Feature Importance**:
     - Analyze feature importance for models that support it (e.g., Random Forests, XGBoost).
  3. **Backtesting**:
     - Implement a backtesting mechanism to simulate trading strategies based on the model's predictions.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Comprehensive evaluation report with visualizations.
  - Insights on model performance and feature importance.

### **Phase 2: Integration of Real-Time Data with Finnhub**

#### **Step 6: Setting Up Finnhub for Live Data Retrieval**
- **Tasks**:
  1. **API Access**:
     - Sign up for Finnhub and obtain an API key.
  2. **API Integration**:
     - Write a Python script to fetch live stock data using Finnhub's API. Test endpoints for real-time data retrieval (e.g., latest price, historical data).
     - Schedule data retrieval using a job scheduler like `cron` for periodic updates or trigger-based updates (e.g., every 15 minutes).
  3. **Data Caching**:
     - Implement caching mechanisms to store fetched data locally to avoid excessive API calls.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Python script for live data retrieval.
  - Documentation on the API integration process.

#### **Step 7: Data Pipeline Development**
- **Tasks**:
  1. **Pipeline Design**:
     - Design an ETL pipeline that automates data fetching, transformation, and storage.
  2. **Data Processing**:
     - Implement real-time data processing using tools like Apache Kafka or Pandas for batch processing.
  3. **Database Integration**:
     - Store the processed live data in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite). Set up tables for raw and transformed data.
  4. **Scheduling and Automation**:
     - Use Apache Airflow to orchestrate the pipeline. Define DAGs to schedule the data fetching, transformation, and loading processes.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Fully automated ETL pipeline for live data.
  - Database schema for storing live and processed data.

#### **Step 8: Model Adaptation for Real-Time Forecasting**
