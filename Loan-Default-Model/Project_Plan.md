# Credit Risk Prediction Model Plan

## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to predict the credit risk of individuals based on demographic, financial, and loan-related features.

## Dataset Overview
### Columns in the Dataset:
- **person_age**: Age of the borrower.
- **person_income**: Annual income of the borrower.
- **person_home_ownership**: Home ownership status (RENT, OWN, MORTGAGE).
- **person_emp_length**: Length of employment (in months).
- **loan_intent**: Purpose of the loan (e.g., PERSONAL, EDUCATION, MEDICAL).
- **loan_grade**: Grade assigned to the loan (A, B, C, D, etc.).
- **loan_amnt**: Loan amount requested.
- **loan_int_rate**: Interest rate for the loan.
- **loan_status**: Target variable indicating whether the loan defaulted (1 = defaulted, 0 = non-defaulted).
- **loan_percent_income**: Loan amount as a percentage of the borrower's income.
- **cb_person_default_on_file**: Whether the borrower has a default record on file (Y/N).
- **cb_person_cred_hist_length**: Length of the borrower’s credit history.

## 1. Data Preparation

### Steps:
1. **Load the Dataset**:
   - Use `pandas` to load the dataset and explore its structure.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing or null values (imputation or removal).
   - Convert categorical variables (e.g., **person_home_ownership**, **loan_intent**, **loan_grade**, **cb_person_default_on_file**) into numerical formats using **one-hot encoding** or **label encoding**.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features if needed (e.g., interactions between **loan_amnt** and **loan_percent_income**).
   - Normalize or scale numerical features like **person_income**, **loan_amnt**, and **loan_int_rate** using **StandardScaler** or **MinMaxScaler**.

4. **Train-Test Split**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
   - Ensure stratified sampling if necessary, to maintain the distribution of **loan_status** in both sets.

## 2. Model Selection

### Steps:
1. **Choose Models**:
   - Test multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best-performing model:
     - Logistic Regression (for interpretability).
     - Random Forest (for feature importance and non-linear relationships).
     - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost or LightGBM for high accuracy).
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM).

2. **Model Training**:
   - Train each model using the training set.
   - Implement **cross-validation** (e.g., **KFold** or **StratifiedKFold**) to ensure model robustness.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Use `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize hyperparameters for each model (e.g., max depth for Random Forest, learning rate for Gradient Boosting).

## 3. Model Evaluation

### Steps:
1. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Use appropriate metrics for binary classification:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1 Score
     - ROC-AUC Score (Area Under the ROC Curve)
   
2. **Confusion Matrix**:
   - Visualize the confusion matrix to evaluate the false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives.

3. **Feature Importance**:
   - For tree-based models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, analyze feature importance to understand the influence of each feature on the model’s predictions.

## 6. Model Comparison
Compare the performance of each model using the evaluation metrics. Choose the model with the best performance (considering both precision/recall and interpretability).

## 4. Final Model and Interpretation

### Steps:
1. **Retrain Final Model**:
   - Retrain the best-performing model on the entire training set.
   
2. **Interpretability**:
   - For models like Logistic Regression, analyze the coefficients to understand the impact of features on default risk.
   - For tree-based models, use feature importance charts to interpret key drivers of credit risk.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Use the final model to make predictions on the test set and assess the results.

## 5. Conclusion and Next Steps
### Steps:
1. **Summarize Findings**:
   - Discuss the performance of the model and key features that affect default risk.
   
2. **Next Steps**:
   - Consider deploying the model via a REST API or integrating it into a business application.
   - Explore the addition of more advanced techniques like **ensemble models** or **deep learning** for further improvement.

3. **Potential Improvements**:
   - If model accuracy is low, explore gathering more data or using synthetic data generation techniques to balance the dataset.
